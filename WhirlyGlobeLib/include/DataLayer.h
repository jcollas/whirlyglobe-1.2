/** A WhirlyGlobe Layer is just an objective C object that
    responds to a certain protocol.  All you have to do is
    fill in the one routine.  If you want to be called at
    regular intervals, you need to schedule yourself in the
    run loop provided with the thread.
    Layers will do things like overlay data on the globe or
    respond to user input.
    Layers do not have to be particularly fast.  At least not
    as fast as they'd have to be in the main run loop.
