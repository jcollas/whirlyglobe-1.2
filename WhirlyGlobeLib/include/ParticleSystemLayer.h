/** Particle System Layer.
    This layer creates and controls particle systems defined by locations
    and a collection attributes in a dictionary.

    A particle system is tied to a specific location where it will spew out
    a large number of individual particles.  The speed, color, and lifetime
    of those particles is controllable.
 
    Location and normal information for a particle system is controlled by
    the ParticleSystem object.  The rest of the parameters are controlled
    by the description dictonary.
    <list type="bullet">
    <item>minLength     [NSNumber float]
    <item>maxLength     [NSNumber float]
    <item>minNumPerSec  [NSNumber float]
    <item>maxNumPerSec  [NSNumber float]
    <item>minLifetime   [NSNumber float]
    <item>maxLifetime   [NSNumber float]
    <item>minPhi        [NSNumber float]

    When a particular parameter has max and min values, we'll randomly select
    a value in between those two for every given particle.
    <list type="bullet">
    <item>length is the distance a particular particle can travel.
    <item>numPerSec is the number of particles to generate per second
    <item>lifetime is how long a particle will live in seconds
    <item>phi is the angle between a particle's normal and the particle system's local north
    <item>color is a single color which will be applied to all particles
    <item>colors is an optional array of colors from which we'll randomly pick one per particle
