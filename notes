You will need three additional libraries to compile WhirlyGlobeLib and WhirlyGlobeApp.

Shapefile Reader:
http://shapelib.maptools.org/
http://download.osgeo.org/shapelib/

Grab shapelib-1.3.0b2 (or better) from that second link.  The version won't matter much.  It doesn't tend to change.
I'm including shapelib by source, and I put it in ../../utilities/shapelib-1.3.0b2/ relative to this directory.

Vector (and other) library:
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

I'm using eigen 2.  I put it under ../../utilities/eigen/ relative to this directory.
Haven't tried it with eigen 3 yet.  No idea if it'll work.

Boost:
http://www.boost.org/

Don't freak out.  You don't have to compile it, just include some of the headers.

I put it under ../../utilities/boost_1_45_0 relative to this directory.  There's a newer version out (there always is) so just grab it and adjust the header paths.
We're not using anything tricky here so newer versions should be fine.

To build WhirlyGlobeLib, run buildlib.sh in the WhirlyGlobeLib directory.  That will produce a release and debug version of the library in the lib directory.  Or just link with what I checked in.  That might work for about a week, knowing Apple.

Then build WhirlyGlobeApp and run.
