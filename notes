You will need two additional libraries to compile WhirlyGlobeLib and WhirlyGlobeApp.

Shapefile Reader:
http://shapelib.maptools.org/
http://download.osgeo.org/shapelib/

Grab shapelib-1.3.0b2 (or better) from that second link.  The version won't matter much.  It doesn't tend to change.
I'm including shapelib by source, and I put it in ../../utilities/shapelib-1.3.0b2/ relative to this directory.

Vector (and other) library:
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

I'm using eigen 2.  I put it under ../../utilities/eigen/ relative to this directory.
Haven't tried it with eigen 3 yet.  No idea if it'll work.

To build WhirlyGlobeLib, run buildlib.sh in the WhirlyGlobeLib directory.  That will produce a release and debug version of the library in the lib directory.  Or just link with what I checked in.  That might work for about a week, knowing Apple.

Then build WhirlyGlobeApp and run.
